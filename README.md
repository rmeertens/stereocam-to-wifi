# stereocam-to-wifi
Super cool. Using ESP chip to stream stereocam data to everybodys computer. 

TODO:
- implement protocol used by VLC (RTP protocol). Possibly convert grayscale to YUYV. 
- find out how to add the stereocam code to this project... normally it should be in ../libraries

- for other people: show simple diagram on how to attach everything
